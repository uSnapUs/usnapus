Someone wants to give us money!

Send an invoice to <%= @user.email %> <%= "(#{@user.name})" if @user.name %>.
<% if @event.landing_page %>
They came from the landing page at "<%= @event.landing_page.path %>" and should be invoiced for US$<%= @event.landing_page.price/100 %>.
<% end %>
Their event is called <%= @event.name %> and it has <%= pluralize @event.photos.count, "photo" %>.

Cheers,
