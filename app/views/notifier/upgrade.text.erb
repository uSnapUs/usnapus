Someone wants to give us money!

Send an invoice to <%= @user.email %> <%= "(#{@user.name})" if @user.name %>.
They should be invoiced for <%= "#{@event.currency}$#{@event.pricing_tier.price_in_currency(@event.currency)/"100".to_d}" %>.
Their event is called <%= @event.name %> and it has <%= pluralize @event.photos.count, "photo" %>.

Cheers,
